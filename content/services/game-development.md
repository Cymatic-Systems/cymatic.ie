We combine deep technical rigor with engine expertise to construct the high-performance systems that make multiplayer worlds feel alive. We focus on the seamless integration of rich clients, stateful game servers, and stateless web APIs.

# Core Capabilities

- **Networking & Replication:** We engineer the invisible constraints of multiplayer. Our expertise spans the stack from raw **TCP/UDP** and **Reliable UDP** transport layers to complex **State Replication** architectures. We implement **Client-Side Prediction**, **Entity Interpolation**, and **Lag Compensation** to ensure fluid gameplay. Bandwidth is optimized using efficient serialization (**Protobuf**, **MsgPack**) for fast, packet-perfect synchronization.
- **Deep Client Engineering:** We don't just script; we extend the engine. We build custom **Game Systems**, **Procedural Mesh Generation**, and performant **Shaders** to achieve unique visual fidelity. We specialize in the tight coupling of **Client-Server Integration**, ensuring local client logic reconciles perfectly with authoritative server snapshots.
- **Scalable Server Architectures:** We architect the full backend spectrum. We build **Stateful Authoritative Servers** (C++, Rust, Kotlin, Java) for core gameplay loops and **Stateless API Servers** for meta-game persistence, player inventory, and UGC storage. We ensure your database and storage layers are optimized for high-frequency access patterns.
- **Reliability & Infrastructure:** Scalability is proven, not guessed. We validate your platform by running **high-CCU bot fleets** (headless clients) to stress-test matchmakers and replication logic, alongside **API load testing** to ensure your backend infrastructure handles launch-day spikes without breaking a sweat.

Whether scaling a competitive shooter or a persistent virtual world, we ensure your game is built on a solid architecture.
