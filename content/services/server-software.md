We architect and build robust backend systems that power modern applications, from high-throughput Game APIs to complex SaaS platforms.

## Our Expertise

*   **Core Tech Stack:** We select the right tool for the job. Our deep expertise lies in **Kotlin** and **Java** (utilizing **Spring**) for enterprise-grade backend systems, while leveraging **Rust** for performance-critical components and **Node.js** for lightweight services.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** We build scalable, decoupled systems that react to change in real-time. Deep experience with **Apache Kafka** ensures your data flows reliably and efficiently across your microservices.
*   **Cloud-Native Design:** We build for the cloud while maintaining architectural flexibility. We design maintainable, platform-agnostic systems that leverage best-in-class cloud capabilities where they provide the most value.
*   **Security First:** We implement defense-in-depth strategies, ensuring secure coding practices, robust secret management, and proper identity handling (OIDC/OAuth2) protect your applications from day one.
*   **Integration Testing:** We ensure reliability by testing services against real dependencies (DBs, Queues) using **Testcontainers**, simulating production environments for CI/CD and local integration testing.
*   **Developer Experience:** We build CI/CD pipelines (**GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, **Jenkins**) and packaging workflows that make shipping software a joy for your team, not a chore.

Whether you need a distributed microservices architecture or a monolithic powerhouse, we deliver server software that forms the solid foundation of your digital product.
